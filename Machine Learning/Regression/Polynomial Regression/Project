14. Can you describe a real-world scenario where polynomial regression would be an appropriate modeling technique?
15. How would you interpret the results of a polynomial regression analysis to make actionable recommendations or predictions?

And here's a project-based question along with the dataset and objective:

### Project-Based Question:

**Objective**: 
You are tasked with building a polynomial regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset provided contains information about housing prices and relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.

**Dataset**: 
You are provided with a CSV file named "housing_data.csv" containing the following columns:
- `Price`: The selling price of the house (dependent variable).
- `Square_Footage`: The square footage of the house.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `Year_Built`: The year the house was built.
- `Lot_Size`: The size of the lot in square feet.
- `Garage_Size`: The size of the garage in square feet.
- `Neighborhood`: The neighborhood where the house is located (categorical).

**Task**:
1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and explore relationships between features and the target variable.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numerical features if necessary.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Build polynomial regression models with different degrees (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic) using the training data.
5. Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and \( R^2 \) on the testing data.
6. Select the best-performing model and visualize the predicted housing prices against the actual prices.
7. Interpret the results and provide recommendations based on the insights gained from the model.

**Additional Notes**:
- You can use Python and libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/seaborn for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- Make sure to document your code and provide clear explanations of your approach and findings in a report or presentation format.

Feel free to modify the project objective or dataset based on your preferences or specific interests!
