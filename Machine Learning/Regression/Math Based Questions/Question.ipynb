    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Polynomial regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable \\( y \\) and an independent variable \\( x \\) by fitting a polynomial equation to the observed data points.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Equation**: A polynomial equation of degree \\( n \\) is represented as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  y = m_n x^n + m_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\ldots + m_2 x^2 + m_1 x + c\n",
    "  \\]\n",

    "  - \\( c \\) is the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Degree of Polynomial**:\n",
    "   - The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) in the equation.\n",
    "   - It determines the maximum number of turns or bends the regression line can have.\n",
    "   - Example: A degree 2 polynomial is \\( y = m_2 x^2 + m_1 x + c \\).\n",
