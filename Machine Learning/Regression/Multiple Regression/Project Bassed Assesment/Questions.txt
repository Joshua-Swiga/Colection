Practical Test:

You have been provided with a dataset containing information about students' exam scores (dependent variable) and their study hours, previous exam scores, and socioeconomic status (independent variables). Your task is to perform multiple linear regression analysis on this dataset using Python and scikit-learn.

1. Read the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
3. Handle any missing values or outliers in the dataset appropriately.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Create an instance of the `LinearRegression()` class from scikit-learn.
6. Fit the linear regression model to the training data.
7. Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing data and calculate the R-squared value.
8. Interpret the coefficients of the independent variables in the regression model.
9. Write a function that takes input values for study hours, previous exam scores, and socioeconomic status, and predicts the exam score for a student using the fitted regression model.
10. Use conditional statements to provide feedback to students based on their predicted exam scores (e.g., "Excellent", "Good", "Satisfactory", "Needs Improvement").

This practical test will assess your ability to perform data analysis, implement linear regression modeling, and integrate conditional statements in Python effectively.
